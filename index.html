    <h2>About me</h2>
    <div class="aboutMe">
      <div class="aboutMePrg">
        <p>As an ambitious and determined computer science major hailing from Afghanistan, I bring a unique perspective and unwavering commitment to my pursuit of a career in the tech industry. My journey from a region with limited educational opportunities and the challenges I've faced, particularly in the wake of the Taliban takeover, have only strengthened my resolve. I've been fortunate to have a family that supports and encourages my educational pursuits, allowing me to explore my passion for technology. Currently, I'm a dedicated student at Cornell University, where I've embraced opportunities to learn about cutting-edge tech and its potential for positive change. With a keen interest in computer science and a minor in business, I aspire to contribute to the tech world's innovation while leveraging my entrepreneurial spirit to create a lasting impact. I am excited about the prospect of collaborating with tech companies and making meaningful contributions to their endeavors</p> <!--Source: This is my own work.-->
