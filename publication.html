            <h2>School Magazine Co-Editor (2021):</h2>
            <p>During my high school years, I had the privilege of co-leading a talented group of students in publishing our school's very first magazine. In this role, I served as the co-editor, co-designer, and co-writer. The experience was transformative, as I learned the art of design and visual storytelling, using tools like Canva to create captivating layouts, harmonizing colors, and integrating imagery. As a writer, I took the initiative to organize a dedicated student committee responsible for collecting data from all school departments, capturing images of various events and student life, gathering student opinions and feedback on school events and achievements, surveying parents about the quality of education, and engaging in constructive discussions with teachers about school improvements. Beyond honing my design and writing skills, this magazine project taught me invaluable lessons about teamwork, leadership, active listening, and effective communication. Copies of our magazine were prominently displayed in the registration office and the principal's office, garnering recognition and praise, including commendations from the Ministry's Board of Education during their visit.</p>

            <h2>Online Debate and Book Clubs Creator (2021):</h2>
            <p>
              During a challenging period of quarantine, I took the initiative to establish online debate and book clubs for in-school students, under the guidance of my English and Communication teacher. This endeavor aimed to make the most of our time in quarantine and foster learning and communication. The impact was significant, as several parents expressed their gratitude for the positive transformations they observed in their children. Students who joined these clubs gained confidence in expressing themselves in English, shared their thoughts and opinions with courage, and expanded their knowledge across various topics. This experience reinforced the value of community and the power of knowledge sharing.</p>
